#Players in the 20-24 age group made the most purchases in the Heroes of Pymoli fantasy game and make up nearly half of the players. A massive percentage of Heroes of Pymoli players are male and made a little over 5 times as many purchases as the other two gender groups combined. Although male players generate the most revenue, players who identify as genders other than male have higher average purchases and seem to purchase the more expensive items. Players in age group "<10" make up a very small amount of the player population, but they have the second highest Average Purchase Total per Person.
